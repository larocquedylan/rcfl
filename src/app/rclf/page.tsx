                <b>Interactive: </b> Conventional leadership forums restrict
                dialogue to experience sharing and questioning. Our approach
                encourages open dialogue and the exchange of advice during
                meetings.

              <li>
                <b>Relatable: </b> We structure our groups around age to ensure
                relatable and meaningful conversations. All members are within
                five years of the average group age.
              </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                <b>Efficient: </b> Our half-day meetings every 4-6 weeks are
                designed to strike the perfect balance between energy (time)
                efficiency and efficacy.
